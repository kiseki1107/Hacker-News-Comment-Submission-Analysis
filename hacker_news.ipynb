    "# Hacker News Comment Submission Analysis\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to collect data from a popular technology site, [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and perform analysis on the popularity of the website's user submissions. Hacker News, which functions similarly to Reddit, is known for its social news geared towards technology, computer science, and entrepreneurship audiences. With the ever-increasing advancements in the technological world today, more news and discussions are submitted in Hacker News occassionally where top posts can get hundreds and thousands of visitors as a result. Particularly, there has been an ongoing popularly with posts whose title begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN` where users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question and `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or interesting topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample Hacker News comments data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) via Kaggle. This data will be collected, cleaned, and analyzed to determine the following:\n",
    "* Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more commentss on average?\n",
    "* Do posts crteated at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For this analysis, the data set was already reduced from almost 300,000 rows to 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions."

Commonly used by most Hacker News users, the `ask hn` and `show hn` posts were compared and analyzed.\n",

To maximize the average comments per `ask hn` post throughout the day, it is recommended to create an `ask hn` post at around 15:00 (or 3:00 pm EST) with an average of 38.59 comments."
